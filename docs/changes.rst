.. Wait until the no side effects PR is merged
1.1X.0
======
* Add option to pass STS credentials to ``s3://`` store by setting the ``is_sts_credentials=true`` url param and passing role params via ``sts_assume_role__*``, e.g. ``sts_assume_role__RoleArn=...``.

1.9.2
=====
* Port setup to use the OSS QuantCo copier template (`copier template https://github.com/Quantco/copier-template-python-open-source`_) and (`pixi https://pixi.sh`_) as environment manager.

1.9.1
=====
* Add a real AWS integration test for S3FSStore
* Add minio test for S3FSStore

1.9.0
=====
* Add `session_token` url param that can be set when creating a `[h]s3://` store
  via `get_store_from_url`.

1.8.6
=====
* We undeprecated ``url2dict`` and ``extract_params`` as these functions turned
  out to be useful in downstream projects.

1.8.5
=====
* Changed generic `IO` type to `BinaryIO`.

1.8.4
=====
* Removing invalid BSD-3 Clause license classifier.

1.8.3

=====
* Drop `pkg_resources` and use `importlib.metadata` to access package version string.
* Add missing `region_name` in `s3fs` store creation to set required location constraint
  during bucket creation.

1.8.0
=====
* Fixed the behaviour of ``S3FSStore`` when providing a custom endpoint.
* Added ``verify`` constructor argument to ``S3FSStore`` that disables SSL verification. Use it in an URI as ``?verify=false``.

* Added ``from_url`` and ``from_parsed_url`` to each store.

* Made the SQLAlchemyStore compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0.

  * Stores and Decorators can now be opened using ``with KeyValueStore as store``
  * Implemented this functionality for baseclasses and the ``AzureBlockBlobStore``

1.4.4

* Bug fixes for Google Cloud Storage:
  * Request correct OAuth scope when creating credentials from URL
  * Conform to ``BufferedIOBase`` class by calling ``super()``

1.4.2

1.3.0
=====

* Moved mixin classes ``UrlMixin`` and ``CopyMixin`` from ``minimalkv`` to
  ``minimalkv._mixins``.
* Moved mixin class ``ExtendedKeyspaceMixin`` from ``minimalkv.contrib`` to
  ``minimalkv._mixins``.
* Moved stores ``KeyValueStore`` and ``UrlKeyValueStore`` from ``minimalkv`` to
  ``minimalkv._key_value_store``.
* Moved functions ``get_store`` and ``get_store_from_url`` from ``minimalkv`` to
  ``minimalkv._get_store``.
* Moved constants ``FOREVER``, ``NOT_SET``, ``VALID_NON_NUM``, ``VALID_KEY_REGEXP`` and
  ``VALID_KEY_RE`` from ``minimalkv`` to ``minimalkv._constants``.

  ``VALID_KEY_RE_EXTENDED`` from ``minimalkv.contrib`` to ``minimalkv._constants``.
* All changes are backwards compatible.

1.2.2
=====

* Improved the API documentation of ``minimalkv``.

1.2.1
=====

* Fixed ``intersphinx`` inventory build on readthedocs to include all classes.

1.2.0
=====

* Add Python 3.6 / 3.9 to build and support matrix.
* Allow creating ``GoogleCloudStore`` via URL
* Fix sphinx intersphinx generation and cleanup docs configuration.

1.1.0
=====

* Merge ``storefact`` into the tree.

1.0.0
=====

* Rename to ``minimalkv``.

0.15.0
======

* Add support for Google Cloud Storage through ``google-cloud-storage`` (for Python3).

0.14.1
======

* Fix support for ``key in store`` for azure with ``azure-storage-blob``.

0.14.0
======

* Add support for ``azure-storage-blob`` version 12. (``azure-storage-blob`` version 2 is still supported.)

0.13.1
======

* Add the optional parameters of the Azure API max_block_size and max_single_put_size to the AzureBlockBlobStore.

0.13.0
======

        prefixes are listed up to the given delimiter.

0.12.0
======

* Use ``BlockBlobService.list_blob_names`` in ``minimalkv.net.azurestore.AzureBlockBlobStore.iter_keys``.
  This will only parse the names from Azure's XML response thus reducing CPU time
  significantly for this function.
* They ``.keys()`` method on Python 3 now returns a list. This is in line with the documentation and the
  behaviour on Python 2. It used to return a generator.

======
* Fix one off in open() method interfaces for azure backend

======
* Fix version in setup.py

0.11.0
======
* The memcached backend has been removed
* Keys have to be provided as unicode strings
* Values have to be provided as bytes (python 2) or as str (python 3)
* keys() and iter_keys() provide a parameter to iterate just over all keys with a given prefix
* Added :class:`minimalkv.CopyMixin` to allow access to copy operations to
  backends which support a native copy operation
* Added a decorator which provides a read-only view of a store:
  :class:`~minimalkv.decorator.ReadOnlyDecorator`

  :class:`~minimalkv.decorator.URLEncodeKeysDecorator`
* Added a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage backend:
  :class:`~minimalkv.net.azurestore.AzureBlockBlobStore`

  This mixin is experimental, unsupported and might not work with all backends.

  minimalkv.memory.memcachestore.MemcacheStore).

===
* Now supports `redis <http://redis.io>`_ backend:
  :class:`~minimalkv.memory.redisstore.RedisStore`.
