class CacheDecorator(StoreDecorator):
    """Write-through cache decorator.

    Can combine two :class:`~minimalkv._key_value_store.KeyValueStore` instances into a
    single caching :class:`~minimalkv._key_value_store.KeyValueStore`. On a data-read
    request, the cache will be consulted first, if there is a cache miss or an error,
    data will be read from the backing store. Any retrieved value will be stored in the
    cache before being forward to the client.

    Write, key-iteration and delete requests will be passed on straight to the
    backing store. After their completion, the cache will be updated.

    No cache maintainenace above this is done by the decorator. The caching
    store itself decides how large to grow the cache and which data to keep,
    which data to throw away.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cache : KeyValueStore
        The caching backend.
    store : KeyValueStore
        The backing store. This is the "authoritative" backend.
